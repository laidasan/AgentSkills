# Notion Skills for Claude

**Notion Skills for Claude are step-by-step guides that teach Claude how to do real work in Notion.** Instead of just answering questions, Skills help Claude complete entire workflows—structuring pages the way your team does, updating databases with the right info, following your brand guidelines, and working through your actual patterns.

Use them to turn a spec into an implementation plan, run research that ends up as a beautiful Notion doc, prep for meetings with context already pulled together, or capture decisions into your wiki or task database. It's a faster way to go from idea to done—and everything ends up organized, shareable, and ready for your team to use.

**To get started:** Download the .zip below, then upload each Skill to Claude. Once loaded, Claude will use them automatically when you're working in Notion.
